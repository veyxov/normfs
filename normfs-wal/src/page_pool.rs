//! A fixed pool of WAL pages that writers wait on.
//!
//! The pool owns one [`WalRing`] — every byte it will ever use is allocated
//! once, at construction — and hands out entry ids as records are appended into
//! pages. When no page can be reclaimed, an appending task **waits** rather than
//! failing or discarding: the pages still hold records that are not yet on disk,
//! and dropping them is the one thing this store must never do.
//!
//! The waiting lives here and not in C. The C ring reports `NEEDS_ROTATE` and
//! `find_reusable` reports "none", and it never blocks, never allocates and
//! never learns what a file is — which is what keeps it portable down to a
//! microcontroller later.
//!
//! ## Why a page can be reused
//!
//! Reuse is governed entirely by the proven C predicate
//! `normfs_wal_page_is_reusable(p, m)`:
//!
//! ```text
//! p->pin_count == 0 && (p->count == 0 || p->last_entry_id < m)
//! ```
//!
//! and `normfs_wal_ring_rotate_to` requires it. The two conjuncts are two
//! different claims, and this module is what gives each its meaning:
//!
//! * `pin_count` — a reader or a stream is still looking at these bytes.
//! * `min_essential_id` — **the bytes are on disk**. [`PagePool::mark_durable`]
//!   is the only thing that advances it, and its caller may only call it after
//!   an `fsync` has returned.
//!
//! Together those give the property the store exists for: a record that
//! `append` accepted is never overwritten in memory until it has been written
//! *and* synced. The C side proves the "never overwritten" half; this module is
//! responsible for never advancing the watermark on anything less than a
//! completed sync.

/// Keeps a page alive for as long as a reader is looking at bytes on it.
///
/// The payload handed out by [`PagePool::pin_range`] is not a copy — it points
/// into the page the record was written into, which is the same memory the WAL
/// file writer takes its bytes from. Nothing else keeps that memory still, so
/// this does: the guard holds a pin for its lifetime and drops it afterwards,
/// including when the read fails or the stream is dropped part-way.
///
/// ## Why the borrow is sound
///
/// A page is reused in exactly one place, `normfs_wal_ring_rotate_to`, and its
/// contract requires `normfs_wal_page_is_reusable`, whose first conjunct is
/// `pin_count == 0`. So a pinned page cannot be reset, and the bytes below
/// `used_bytes` cannot change: appends only ever move that cursor forward, into
/// space this slice does not cover. The arena is allocated once and never
/// reallocated, and the `Arc` keeps the pool — and with it the arena — alive
/// for at least as long as the guard.
///
/// That is what the pin conjunct was always for. Until now nothing pinned
/// anything, so it read as a precaution against a caller that did not exist;
/// with reads borrowing from pages it carries its intended meaning.
///
/// ## Provenance
///
/// `ptr` comes from [`WalRing::record_ptr`], which derives it from the arena
/// base the C ring writes through. It is deliberately not taken from a `&[u8]`
/// over the page: that would give the pointer a temporary reference's
/// provenance while C keeps writing the same allocation through an older
/// pointer, which under Stacked Borrows entitles an append to invalidate a tag
/// this guard is still holding — a page it may not touch, argued from a rule
/// that does not care. Deriving from the base the writes already use settles
/// it structurally instead.

    /// by an unbounded channel and `NormFS::enqueue` releases the append gate
    /// between them, so entries reach the writer out of order and wait in its
    /// `OrderedBuffer`. Without a bound, a flush landing in that window writes
    /// the later record first.
    ///
    /// `note_handed_over` is the writer saying "this id is mine now", in the id
    /// order its buffer restores. Nothing above that id is taken, and a page is
    /// cut at the offset of the first entry beyond it — which the page's own
    /// offset table gives exactly, so the cut is between two entries and never
    /// inside one.
