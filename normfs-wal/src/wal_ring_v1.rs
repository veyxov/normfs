//! Safe wrapper over the verified C V1 WAL paged memory store.
//!
//! Rust owns the memory: one arena of `page_count * page_size` bytes plus the
//! page-descriptor array. The C layer (proven with Frama-C WP) does the
//! appends, offset table, rotation choice and cursor arithmetic; this module
//! sequences them and hands back safe slices.
//!
//! Page `k` is the slice of the arena at `k * page_size`. That is not an
//! implementation detail — it is what the C side's separation argument rests
//! on. With one buffer per page, "no two pages overlap" is an axiom the caller
//! supplies and every mutation has to carry across itself, as a quantifier over
//! every *pair* of pages; the automatic provers do not transport it. As slices
//! of one allocation it is arithmetic on one valid block instead, so the
//! separation clause becomes three flat statements about base pointers that no
//! mutation assigns, and it survives by frame.
