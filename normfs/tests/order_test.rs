//! so the byte order in a WAL file *is* the id order. Two records swapped there
//! are not one record out of place: every entry from that point on answers to
//! the wrong id, permanently, and nothing reports an error.
//!
//! These tests therefore assert the sequence twice. Once through the reader,
//! which is what a client sees, and once by decoding the WAL files directly,
//! which is what is actually on disk. A reader that reconstructs the right
//! answer from the wrong bytes would pass the first and fail the second.
