//! Shared setup for the end-to-end NormFS throughput benchmarks.
//!
//! Manual throughput programs, not Criterion: one pass over a multi-GiB dataset
//! does not fit its repeat-and-sample model.
//!
//! Nothing here is configurable by environment variable. A benchmark whose
//! numbers depend on how it was invoked cannot be compared against a pasted log,
//! so every run has the same shape and prints it.
//!
//! Two choices are worth stating because they decide what is being measured:
//!
//!   * [`BLOCK_SIZE`] is a sensor message. Small records are the workload the
//!     WAL exists for, and the only size at which per-entry framing is a
//!     meaningful fraction of the file.
//!   * Compression and encryption are off. `QueueConfig::default()` is Zstd +
//!     AES, and leaving them on would measure a codec compressing a synthetic
//!     block rather than the WAL path. Turn them on in `settings` to measure
//!     the production stack instead.
//!
//! Nothing offloads to the store: the per-queue cap is disabled, so a read stays
//! in the WAL rather than measuring a WAL/store/memory mix that shifts with
//! offload timing.
//!
//! Read benchmarks reuse the dataset a write left behind, so the writer records
//! what it produced and the reader refuses anything else. Otherwise a directory
//! from an earlier run of a different shape is measured silently.
